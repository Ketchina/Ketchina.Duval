### Project

- **[Analysis of Cellphone User Behavior](https://github.com/Ketchina/portfolio/blob/main/Project/User%20behavior%20analysis%20.pdf)**  

This analysis aimed to examine key relationships within the dataset. A linear regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of app usage on battery drain, revealing that increased app usage significantly accelerates battery depletion. A t-test comparing data usage between Android and iOS operating systems showed no substantial difference in usage patterns. Additionally, a chi-square test demonstrated a significant association between gender and user behavior, with males exhibiting a slightly higher engagement compared to females. All tests were performed with an alpha of 0.05.

- **[Data visualization of the Office] (./Project/User%20behavior%20analysis.pdf)**
- 
I used R studio to perform some analysis and visualization of the office seasons and character lines.
